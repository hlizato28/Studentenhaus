# Studentenhaus
Me and 1 of my friends made a website for our project in Database 2 class. This website is called StudentenHaus which serves as a market place for students. This website allows students who have cars to offer transfer services to other students who want to move from one dorm to another. In addition, there is also a forum that allows students to sell their used goods. The server that we used for our database was the server of University of Applied Science Brandenburg.

# Studentenhaus
Me and 3 of my friends made a website for our project in Usability and Software Ergonomics class. This website is called EasyJob which functions as a job vacancy portal. We built this website using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS for the frontend and SQL for the backend. The server that we used for our database was the server of University of Applied Science Brandenburg.
